## 21. ADDITIONAL QA CHECKS (Added 2026-03-14)

> Based on bugs discovered during QA passes on localterra devnet.

### 21.1 Swap — Decimals & Amount Verification

| # | Test Case | Steps | Expected Result | Status | Notes |
|---|-----------|-------|-----------------|--------|-------|
| 21.1.1 | On-chain amount matches UI input | Swap 100 tokens → Query on-chain balance before/after | Balance decreases by exactly 100 × 10^decimals | | |
| 21.1.2 | Balance refreshes after swap | Complete swap → Observe balance display | Balance updates in UI without manual page refresh | | |
| 21.1.3 | MAX button sends correct scaled amount | Click MAX → Execute swap | Full balance deducted on-chain | | |
| 21.1.4 | Multiple rapid swaps | Execute 3 swaps in quick succession | All succeed, balances correct after each | | |
| 21.1.5 | Swap on all pairs | Cycle through every pair, execute small swap | All pairs execute successfully | | |
| 21.1.6 | Gas estimation accuracy | Execute swap → Compare gasWanted vs gasUsed | gasUsed does not exceed gasWanted | | |

### 21.2 Pool — Decimals & Amount Verification

| # | Test Case | Steps | Expected Result | Status | Notes |
|---|-----------|-------|-----------------|--------|-------|
| 21.2.1 | Provide liquidity amount matches on-chain | Add 100 tokens → Query pool reserves | Reserves increase by 100 × 10^decimals | | |
| 21.2.2 | Withdraw returns correct scaled amount | Withdraw LP → Check returned tokens | Returned amounts match expected proportional share | | |
| 21.2.3 | Add/remove on multiple pairs | Provide + withdraw on 3+ different pairs | All succeed with correct amounts | | |

### 21.3 Wallet — Persistence & Edge Cases

| # | Test Case | Steps | Expected Result | Status | Notes |
|---|-----------|-------|-----------------|--------|-------|

| 21.3.2 | Keplr chain suggestion | First Keplr connect on fresh browser | experimentalSuggestChain fires, chain appears in Keplr | | |
| 21.3.3 | Wallet reconnect retry | Connect Keplr → Refresh quickly | Auto-reconnect retries up to 3× with 600/1200/1800ms backoff | | |

| 21.5.2 | Account sequence mismatch | Rapid sequential txs cause mismatch | Clear error message displayed, not silent failure | | |
| 21.5.3 | Wallet not funded on chain | Connect unfunded wallet → Attempt tx | Clear "account not found" error message | | |
